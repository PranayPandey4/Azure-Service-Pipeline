Here is one example to Build an ASP.NET Core 2.0 web application to an App Service (Windows) via VSTS. You could adapt it with your own context, needs and constraints.

![Build Overview](/docs/imgs/AspDotNetCore-AppServiceWindows-CI.PNG)

Let's [create a new YAML build definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/actions/build-yaml#manually-create-a-yaml-build-definition).

*For now, the graphical representation of the tasks doesn't exist with the YAML definition. If you would like you could manually reproduce the tasks defined [in this file](../vsts/AspDotNetCore-AppServiceWindows-CI.yml) via the UI editor.*
